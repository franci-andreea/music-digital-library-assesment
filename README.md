# Digital Music Library

This project represents my implementation for the technical assessment received by MMCTech.
It is a web application which makes possible to view artists, albums and details for each one of them. 

This repository contains the frontend side of the whole application and is built using [ReactJS](https://react.dev/) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), HTML and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/).
